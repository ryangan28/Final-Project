**Organic Farm Pest Management AI System**

1.  **Project Scenario**

Organic farming represents a growing sector of agriculture, with farmers
committed to sustainable practices that avoid synthetic pesticides and
fertilizers. However, pest management remains one of the most
challenging aspects of organic farming, requiring:

- Quick and accurate pest identification to prevent crop damage

- Knowledge of organic-approved treatment methods

- Understanding of integrated pest management (IPM) principles

- Timely intervention to minimize economic losses

2.  **Problem Statement**

Many organic farmers, especially small-scale and emerging farmers, face
significant challenges:

*Knowledge Gap*: Limited expertise in pest identification leads to
delayed or incorrect treatments, resulting in crop losses averaging
15-25% annually.

*Remote Locations*: Many farms operate in areas with poor or no internet
connectivity, making online resources inaccessible during critical
decision-making moments.

*Time Sensitivity*: Pest outbreaks can spread rapidly; farmers need
immediate identification and treatment guidance, often outside business
hours when agricultural extension services are unavailable.

*Resource Constraints*: Small organic farms cannot afford expensive pest
management consultants or laboratory identification services.

*Certification Requirements*: Organic farmers must use only approved
treatment methods to maintain their certification, requiring specialized
knowledge of organic pest control options.

3.  **Project requirements**

- You will develop an intelligent, conversational AI system with
  advanced computer vision capabilities that serves as a comprehensive
  pest management consultant for organic farmers. The system will
  operate entirely offline on edge computing devices, enabling farmers
  to capture or upload images of crop pests and receive immediate,
  expert-level identification along with tailored organic treatment
  recommendations.

- You need to use your developed or fine-tuned models during this course
  in this project.
