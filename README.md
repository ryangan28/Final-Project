## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Web Interface

# Start the web application
python start.py

# Access at http://localhost:8501
# 1. Upload pest images via drag-drop or camera
# 2. Get instant EfficientNet-based identification
# 3. Click "Chat About Treatment" for LM Studio consultation
# 4. Receive organic treatment recommendations
```

### Model Training (EfficientNet)
```bash
# Train the EfficientNet ensemble
cd training
python improved_train.py

# The training process:
# 1. Loads Agricultural Pest Dataset (12 classes)
# 2. Applies stratified K-fold cross-validation (5 folds)
# 3. Trains EfficientNet-B0 with agricultural augmentations
# 4. Saves models with temperature scaling to models/improved/
```

## 🧠 How the CNN is Trained

### Training Pipeline Overview
The EfficientNet-B0 ensemble is trained using a sophisticated pipeline designed for agricultural pest classification:

#### 1. **Data Preparation**
```python
# Dataset Structure: 12 pest classes from Agricultural Pest Dataset
# - ants, bees, beetle, catterpillar, earthworms, earwig
# - grasshopper, moth, slug, snail, wasp, weevil
# Each class contains 100+ high-quality agricultural images
```

#### 2. **Agricultural-Specific Augmentations**
```python
# Custom augmentations for real farm conditions:
- Random lighting variations (dawn/dusk/cloudy conditions)
- Soil texture overlays and dirt spots simulation
- Weather effects (rain droplets, dust particles)
- Camera angle variations (farmer perspective)
- Color jittering for different lighting conditions
```

#### 3. **Model Architecture**
```python
class EfficientNetClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=12, dropout_rate=0.3):
        # Pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 backbone (ImageNet weights)
        self.backbone = models.efficientnet_b0(weights='DEFAULT')
        
        # Custom classifier head:
        # Dropout(0.3) → Linear(1280→512) → ReLU → Dropout(0.15) → Linear(512→12)
        
        # Temperature scaling for uncertainty calibration
        self.temperature = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(1))
```

#### 4. **Training Strategy**
```python
# Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation (5 folds)
config = {
    'num_epochs': 100,
    'learning_rate': 1e-4,
    'weight_decay': 1e-4,
    'batch_size': 32,
    'patience': 15,           # Early stopping
    'min_delta': 1e-4        # Minimum improvement threshold
}

# Each fold trains independently:
# - 80% training, 20% validation
# - Best model saved based on validation accuracy
# - Temperature scaling calibrated post-training
```

#### 5. **Uncertainty Quantification**
```python
# Monte Carlo Dropout during inference:
# - Dropout layers kept active during prediction
# - 20 forward passes per image
# - Mean prediction + standard deviation = uncertainty estimate
# - Temperature scaling calibrates confidence scores
```

#### 6. **Training Results**
```
Fold 0: 93.631% validation accuracy
Fold 1: 93.540% validation accuracy  
Fold 2: 93.358% validation accuracy
Fold 3: 92.903% validation accuracy
Fold 4: 92.077% validation accuracy

Average: 93.1% validation accuracy
Ensemble: >95% expected accuracy due to model diversity
```

#### 7. **Production Deployment**
```python
# All 5 models loaded as ensemble:
# - Inference runs on all models simultaneously
# - Predictions averaged for final result
# - Uncertainty calculated across models
# - Real-time performance: ~2-3 seconds per image
```
